# dinner-time

Thank you for taking the time to look at my first created project, called Dinner Time! This application saught to squash out the indecision that plagues us all when deciding what it is that we wish to eat come dinner time. With a simple yes or no style of questioining, the user is asked whether they wish to remain inside (thier home) or go outside (a resturant) for dinner. Depending on the choice, and with the use of simplified static HTML pages, the user is routed to be taken to a new page which helps them make decisions based on their original choice. 

Should the user have said that they wish to stay in for dinner, they will be asked what ingredients that they have an using a food based API, in this case, Edemam, will be guided through several recipies that they could create given the ingredients that they have.

Should the user have said that they wish to go out for dinner, using a simplified form of the google maps API they will be asked what type (or genre) of food it is that they wish to consume and will be guided to nearby resturants that pertain to that tag type, with details following under the map of the score of the resturant and other pertinant details to help them determine whether or not they should want to dine there.

Of course, the user is not ever locked into their original decision, such as is the mind of the individual, should they want at any time the navigational buttons stay at the top should they wish to change their mind from wanting to go out and decide to stay in, or vice versa.

We hope that this application sates all your coding, and food related desires!
